# Day 4

Trying to recover previous results and fix isolate player.

Try out new shot detection method with ball/player overlap and speed of ball change.

Structure of dataframe of isolated players.

Split player_df into 4 dataframes, one for each player. Just keep that? And get stats on all of those?

Then I could look at each player separately and figure out what shots they hit, how they moved. Easier to plot and examine.
Then process the shots, does it make sense for them to be hitting a shot at that time, where is the ball before and after the shot.

# Now getting 7 serving outcomes and 8 ends wrong, why?


Drivetrain approach - how does it apply to this project.

What's the defined objective?

Improve performance through more detailed and timely feedback on own play and opponents play.

Provide in-depth live statistics for tennis matches.
Provide a searchable timestmaped video to allow quick analysis of tennis matches.

Could have a human in the loop checking. So we want the model to track the ball/racquet/players/audio and provide predictions of what they thought happened.
We can then correct.

Fixed previous issues. Some of the points should be cleaned up if we can improve racquet detection so going to focus on improving that. Back to the tagging grind.
