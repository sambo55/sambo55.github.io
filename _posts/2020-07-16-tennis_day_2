# Tennis log

Goals for today :

1. Map out errors for shot type
2. Write and test rules to correct all bugs

Other ideas I've thought of, could we train a classifier on the last ball graphs to identify outcome/ multiple shots?
Not going to have a huge amount of samples for that, also would need to train it on ones from outside for it to be fair. 

How long would it take to get samples and label them for all points? Maybe not that long. 

Fixed a couple of bugs kind of, some will just be hard to do - will need to use context which is not ideal but fine.

Last big one to fix is missing overlaps and only detecting ones where they are missing. 

Promising, cross referencing audio hits with overlaps and ball location should be able to clear up a few more errors, only 23 to go.

First thing tomorrow - clean up point 66, getting muddled with the serving end and serve_outcome.
