# Ideas

I need a method that is going to detect every hit with a lot of false positives.

Ball and player IOU might be the best method for that

Ball/player/racquet could work if racquet detections were better maybe but may as well try ball and player to start with. 

Test - make sure bp_iou shots are all higher than num_shots and aud num_shots.

Still have issues with isolate player mechanism - good test is how similar the player counts are after each stage. 

Another way it fails is by counting one box as two players. How to detect that? Duplicates?

Try 0.25 and if player counts are too different then lower to 0.1/0.01

How many bad outcomes are caused by this?

Failure modes, missing enough that we lose the overlap, and lose track of the player. 
Missing enough that box jumps to another player.

How to fix that? Improve player detections(lower thresh?)

How the fuck is player isolate actually working? How does it know? Broken it so have to rewrite anyway.

Potential solve - redo all of the player dets with a far lower detection threshold. Use 0.8 for the initial player settings but then use a much lower threshold for 
tracking/iou purposes.

Broken badly - no idea how it was working so well before using the same audio_frame and getting the end wrong, or it didn't matter about that?

Could potentially recreate with player_df confs >= 0.8
And try the various combos of 0.01 / 0.25, 0.25 only, 0.25/0.25
