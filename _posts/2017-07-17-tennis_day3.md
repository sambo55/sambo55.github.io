# Day 3

Ideas - self-tracking experiment. Track food, time, exercise, money, energy, dry skin for 1 month. Is that valuable, how long would that take? Let's see.

Takeaways from pinnacle data camp article, 
good understanding of what is required to be successful betting company. 

Things I need to dig in to a bit more are
bayesian inference, what ML models can account for that?
are genetic algorithms still relevant?
find some examples of people putting code into production - what are the key ideas(testing, speed, updating)

Tennis - 

Goal - fix point 66 end, keep going through the shots vs aud_shots list


Results today

Fixed end for 66 and 106.

Outcome errors around 20

Errors in num_shots far higher - need to get a good feel for this and think about ways to make it better. 

Fix gaps between num_shots and aud num_shots.

Correct for second serve points

Initial thoughts - aud num shots is quite good, how to improve it.

Look at where the ball is, check the bp_iou during that time.
Check for long gaps between shots, too short of a gap

Have aud_only make a prediction about outcome and shot_type and compare them. 

Have a ball only model for when a shot has occured. Ball player

Multiple ways and can play them off against each other.


Other to-do's

Improve audio detection - better outcall detection, splitting up long clips, returning confidence level of each hit/outcall
Improve racquet detection.

Write out process for doing that. What files are where.
